Looking at the complete circuit it would seem that it only took an hour to build, but it actually took over 10 because of so many little kinks that had to be worked out. At the end, however, I was fascinated that I even had the skills to build a heart rate monitor out of common circuit elements, and it made me feel better about my toolbox of engineering skills. It really emphasized the ubiquitousness of electrical engineering for me and how much creativity truly goes into engineering to solve these difficult problems, and made me excited to be an engineer. \n","> <br>\n","> <br>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JCTR82JHzBnu"},"source":["---\n","## Lingering Questions & Suggestions \n","\n","*Detail any questions you have about the material covered.
